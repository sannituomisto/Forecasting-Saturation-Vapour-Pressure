# Forecasting Saturation Vapour Pressure

This final report presents the results of the group project for the course Introduction to Machine Learning. The objective was to develop a regression-based machine learning model to predict saturation vapor pressure using the GeckoQ dataset [1], which contains atomic structures of 31,637 atmospherically relevant molecules derived from the oxidation of α-pinene, toluene, and decane. The model’s performance was evaluated using the R² score, which was calculated by comparing our predictions on the test data with the ground truth labels, accessible only to the course staff.
