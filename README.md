# Forecasting Saturation Vapour Pressure

This is a final report for the group project of the course Introduction to Machine Learning.
The task was to build a regression-based machine learning model that predicts saturation vapour pressure using the GeckoQ dataset [1] with atomic structures of 31,637 atmospherically relevant molecules resulting from the oxidation of ùõº-pinene, toluene and decane.
